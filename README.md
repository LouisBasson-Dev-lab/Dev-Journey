# Dev-Journey
This is the start

Today is the start of my Dev journey after recovering from all of the damage COVID has done to my life.

2020 came about and ripped my whole life appart, from loosing my income to loosing everything I owned. House ,cars ,boats and more. I had to start all over in life , working temp farm labour jobs during Covid.

Eventually getting back into the IT industry. October 2022 I got a position again in IT as a Linux Administrator after applying to over 300 positions. 
I have built my life back up from there to have something of what resembles a normal life again.

I have reached a point where I can start planning a better career and future, starting my Software Developer Journey. 

This is not going to be easy to transistion from over 30 years in the Operations space to Dev space.

I can do this !!! I know I can !!!

My journey will start with a study plan as follows:
      1: Front end developer
      2: Email developer
      3: Javascript and React developer
      4: Blockchain Developer

This will be the future of ME !!!!!  ( Louis Basson)
